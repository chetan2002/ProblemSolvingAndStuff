Let's call a sequence of integers good if the product of its elements can be represented as a difference of squares of two integers. More formally, a sequence S1,S2,…,SK is good if it is possible to find two integers p and q such that S1⋅S2⋅…⋅SK=p2−q2.

Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,AN. He wants to find the number of contiguous subsequences of A which are good. Can you help him?

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of good contiguous subsequences of A.

Constraints
1≤T≤103
1≤N≤105
|Ai|≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Explanation
Example case 1: For the subsequences [1] and [3], their products can be represented as differences of two squared integers: 1=12−02 and 3=22−12 respectively.

Example case 2: The two good subsequences are [5] and [2,5,6]. Their products can be represented as differences of two squared integers: 5=32−22 and 2⋅5⋅6=60=82−22 respectively.
